## What's this?

This is a plugin that will allow you to listen to any music you want, from peaceful video game music all the way to hard rock, at least, in noteblocks. You can listen by your own or if you feel like playing with a friend, you can even listen along with them! A simple yet well-crafted GUI will give you the ability to customize your experience to the maximum.
